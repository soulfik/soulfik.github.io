						<p> 	The sun leapt from behind a cloud, and light slammed against the window, casting fractured shards of color onto the polished marble floor.  Normally appreciative of the beautiful stained glass windows in the Hall of the Council, Danilan muttered to himself and squeezed his eyes shut to avoid the glare.  This hall had been the seat of many of his finest accomplishments over the years, but this latest decision spelled disaster.  Danilan ground his teeth. It wasn’t even a decision that the Council had made, but yet another lack of one.  The council be damned. It was time to act. He thought of the bribes he had paid to his fellow councilors, and the promises they had broken. Nothing changed.
					Danilan walked quickly through the halls of the palace of the Council of Sharia. Sharia was the grandest city left in the country, and had been elected Capital dozens of years ago by the Council.  It had originally been built for such a role, but other cities had served as the Capital since. Certain noble families had thought to elevate their power by holding the Capital in their ancestral home. Danilan smiled to himself. He’d made sure it hadn’t been profitable.  Power belonged here, shared by all who represented the people of Wildrian.
					Summer light flashed through the scattered leaves of trees onto Danilan’s wrinkled face as he hurried through a courtyard.  He mostly ignored the exquisite arched doorways between the tiles of the palace and the dirt of the small grove.  His Bastion was located in this grove, and his quick stride hastened further as his home came into view.
				There were other Bastions in the city, but only one other inside the actual Council’s Palace.  Many mages, wizards, and spell casters had a Bastion, which served as a combination of home, library, and research facility. The Council ruled the city of Sharia, which, in turn, ruled all of Wildrian.  Wildrian was still a powerful country, but so much had changed in the past few decades. He looked up at the pale rose stone of his Bastion, inherited because of his position as First Councilor. For all the good that had done him. Or anyone. Centuries ago, when Wildrian had first been founded as a country, the position of First Councilor had meant something. Political infighting had weakened the position, and now, a First Councilor couldn’t do anything without the backing a Council majority. So nothing ever got done, and Wildrian continued to decay. Rivers went dry, borders were freely violated, and the common citizen was trampled.  The entire western half of the country was seriously threatened by drought, but still the Council deliberated.
					Annoyed with such somber thoughts, Danil flicked his hand at the mist that seemed to hang around the entryway of his tower.</p>

					<p>“Shoo!” he said testily, annoyed at himself for his lack of composure.  The rest of the council had refused his ideas again, this time officially.  The very concept of Wildrian asking for help from another nation was completely unacceptable. Heavens forfend that the mighty country of Wildrian ask anyone for assistance, regardless of the fact that her roads were falling apart, her schools and hospitals failing, and her borders were being ignored by enemies. For so many years, Wildrian had been the country that the rest of the civilized world looked up to.
					Danil sighed. Focus on solutions, not the issues. A gentle surge of power flowed through Danilan, and the mist dissipated quickly, urged on by Danilan’s will.  Sleeping mist was a specialty of Danilan’s.  He chose to make it visible so that others would stay away from his Bastion.  Some mages guarded their Bastion with deadly spells, but Danilan found killing with magic abhorrent. His servants could freely exit the Bastion, but knew better than to try and come back in. The apprentices living with him had charms to allow them entry. 
					Matters had not deteriorated so far that he expected thieves in the Palace, but nosy councilmen and their spies were an entirely different matter. Danilan snorted. The way things had been going, thieves in the palace wouldn’t have surprised him. Sharia was still a relatively safe city, thanks to regular patrols of guardsmen and mages, but the Council’s palace was a nest of intrigue.
				Danil nodded grimly at the bow of one of the palace servants, and began stomping up the steps to his Bastion.  His mind was set.  This is what needed to happen.  He wasn’t soothed by the alternating patterns of different blue tiles that lined the inside of his tower stairwell.  Every so often, there was an expertly placed iridescent pattern of nacre, a design that reminded Danilan of the sea by his family’s home. The patterns reacted to Danilan’s passage, glowing faintly in response to his magical aura. The First Councilor always had free use of this Bastion in the Councilor’s palace, but not every First Councilor was a mage.  Just the vast majority. Those with magical abilities made better rulers, after all. History and logic showed this.
				</p>
				<p> Open arches were spaced at head height every so many steps along the tower stairway.  They were shielded, of course, lest rain get in during a storm, but they allowed a refreshing breeze in. Danilan paused at one of the arches and looked out briefly.  He saw the gardens outside his Bastion, along with workers tending them.  I wonder how many of those gardeners are in the pay of other councilors? Or even other countries? Danilan had hirelings among the other councilors’ workers, of course. It simply wouldn’t do for him to be blindsided by a surprise bill being passed, or other ridiculous legal frippery the other councilors attempted to pass as soon as his back was turned. He had some contacts that reported to him in Mejiran to the south, and Candia to the north as well. For all the good they’d done him. 
				Danilan continued up the stairs, trying to calm his pulse at the latest outrage. More border crystals “borrowed” by the two neighboring nations.  The spells protecting northern Wildrian from blizzards and other destructive weather were already dangerously weak. Would the removal of these border crystals cause the magical protections to fail completely? Danilan didn’t know, and the council did not seem to care. The council had done nothing when the border intrusion detection spells had failed a few years ago.  Even worse, Candian troops were now stationed below the border! But Wildrian couldn’t complain; they needed to project a political image of invincibility and unending wealth.  The council didn’t appear to see or care that nobody believed in this anymore. Enough bribes in the right pockets, and the country of Wildrian did nothing in response. Danilan banished memories of similar bribes he’d taken in the past. This was different. Or maybe it wasn’t. It didn’t matter anymore. With these latest border crystals being taken, Wildrian no longer had a secure border. A harsh winter was only a few months away, and the people of Wildrian were vulnerable.
					He rushed up his stairs, but slowed by his second floor work room, a cheery fire illuminating redwood bookshelves and tables of manuscripts, scrolls, and various magical devices.  A servant smiled at him, pausing in the process of laying out Danilan’s lunch. Danilan’s nerves quieted at the sight.  His minor empathic senses told him that all was well in his Bastion, or at least that this servant was contented and peaceful.  He reached out to link with the Bastion’s greater matrix. No breaches or other magical anomalies. There had been too many of those, of late. Reports came in from all over the country of terrible magical accidents. News traveled so slowly without magical aid, which was now scarce in Wildrian. He paused a moment on the stairs, peering into one of his rooms.
					The heavily cushioned reading chair called to Danilan as it sat in front of the fire, displaying its comfort for all to see. He was tired. And he’d been tired. He was a spent old man, desperately trying to hold together a country that didn’t want his help. Maybe he should call off this entire plan, and just spend the evening reading. The temptation was strong, but responsibility won out.  He tried not to slow in his trek up the stairs again, not even to look at the skillfully painted frescoes decorating the ceiling and walls, nor to enjoy the landings placed every so often along the stairs which held further shielded windows, book cases and comfortable chairs. “I can rest when I succeed,” Danilan whispered to himself.
					He did pause at the third landing.  “Might as well,” he muttered to himself.  “A spell like this needs a lot of power.”  With both hands he grabbed what looked like a large golden glowing hunk of pale pink rock from his bedside, and Danilan smiled. A feeling of contentment spread through him as he gripped the rock, power and mana humming through it. There was no way he could fail.  His eyebrows came together. Sharia City and the country of Wildrian needed him.  The world needed him. He spent a moment pondering the arrogance of the old, and sighed. He sent his magical senses into the crystal, feeling the splendor and warmth of divine power. Once Daymos, God of Flaming Justice, could be called upon to protect the people. This could have been a problem for the Gods to solve.
					</p>
						
						<p> No longer. Danilan hefted the crystal, a piece of the core of Daymos’ heart. Other shards existed, pieces of a dead God’s heart being one precious commodity that the Council had sold or traded away.  Or which had been stolen. Disgusting. Daymos had been diminishing for a century, according to his priests. His last great gift had been to bear his heart for all the world, allowing justice and truth to spread. It was supposed to usher in a golden age of freedom for everyone. Only something terrible had happened. The heart had shattered, and Daymos was gone. We’re alone in this.
						Danilan was nearing the end of his life. After almost forty years alive, he could find few noteworthy accomplishments that he was really proud of.  At least he could do something, find someone else to help.</p>
					<p>Back on the stairwell, Danilan rushed up to the top floor, to the main spell chamber. In the middle of the large room was a spell circle composed of dark blue tiles surrounded by concentric circles of lighter blue tiles.  The pattern faded into white tile, placed at the outer ring of the spell circle. Danilan set the glowing shard on the center dark blue tiles, muttering some binding spells to seal the link and activate his circle. A familiar warmth activated in his mind. He’d used this room many hundreds of times.
				Heavily warded stained glass windows, also done in blue, let in streams of cerulean light to illuminate the circular chamber.  One lonely bookshelf sat beyond the spell circle.  Danilan gently lifted a moldering tome off of one of the top shelves and briefly assessed the preservations spells he had placed on it when he had taken the book from the library. Hopefully they would prevent any additional damage to the priceless book. Danilan carefully placed the tome onto a lectern near the bookshelf and flipped it open, immediately finding the correct page.
				The book had been safely locked in the Sharian Grand Library.  As First Councilor, it was within his power to appoint the Council Librarian.  Ever since the Yusuf had died last winter, nobody had taken care of the books.  This was a shame, but it also meant that nobody noticed when Danilan had borrowed this ancient spell book. He’d have to remember to appoint someone, possibly Baron Chancelry’s younger son, whatever his name was.  He was a scholar of some skill, although his father believed him a useless fop.  He could surely capitalize on the son’s bitterness towards his unloving father. 
				Danilan paused. He stared at his hands, wrinkled and spotted.  Was this the right choice? The council had forbidden him to make entreaties to other countries and kingdoms after the last diplomatic incident.  Wildrian was dying. He gritted his teeth. If the Councilors refused to ask other countries, Danilan would find someone who could help. Maybe diplomacy with other countries wasn’t the right answer. Danilan wasn’t sure anymore.  But something had to be done.
				</p>
				<p>	With a finger marking his place in the ancient tome, Danilan began to chant, loudly and clearly.  Green light sprang violently from his spell circle. Danilan gasped. Tiles from his spell circle began to vibrate and buzz against each other.  The windows quivering in their frames. 
				Most spells were powered by Mana Crystals.  Often referred to as stones, or simply crystals, Mana Crystals were used to store magical energies, and came in lesser and greater varieties. Some stones held barely any power, and others were incredibly powerful.
				Each magic user had a well of mana inside of them, which slowly refilled as the day went on.  Some researchers said that one’s personal well refilled faster when sleeping, but the results were inconclusive.  One could only use magic until the well ran out, unless one was using a mana crystal.   Mana crystals served as an alternative well – one could drain a mana crystal first, before using one’s personal mana. Because of this, mana crystals were incredibly valuable. Most mana crystals recharged more slowly than a person would, but some didn’t.  You could theoretically use any mana crystal to power any spell, but most mana crystals had a specific purpose, or focus, which they lended their mana to more readily, or more efficiently.   This particular Crystal was a shard of a God’s heart, and was deeply attuned to fire, and protection.  Neither of these was likely to assist in this spell, but this shard of Daymos’ heart was the most powerful mana Crystal that Danilan had ever laid his hands upon.
				Danilan drew power deeply from the shard, and the light mellowed to a pale blue. Daymos help me. Let this succeed! A gentle tone rang forth as the crystal glowed bright red. The room began to warm considerably. Danilan sighed, relieved to be committed, and continued casting.  This had to be the right thing to do.  He felt the energy draining rapidly from the Crystal in the middle of his spell circle.
				</p>
							<p>As the calling spell finished, a great dizziness swept over Danilan.  He wasn’t young anymore, he realized, but this was important.  He felt a coldness spreading through his limbs and chest, and his breath came raggedly. A sharp, throbbing pain lanced up his left arm. He threw the rest of his power into the spell, willing it to completion. Sharia needs saving. Wildrian needs saving. Please.
					All at once, a huge vision of eyes, big as plates and brilliant as lightning, flashed in front of him. These eyes seemed to stare deep into Danilan, their irises filled with stars. His empathic senses were overloaded with a feeling of approval, like the feeling a father might have for a son’s well-done deed. The feeling was so strong that Danilan was temporarily blinded and stunned.
					Danilan stumbled back.  The huge eyes continued to stare at him, stars whirling and spiraling. All of the warmth had returned to his body. The pain was gone.  He looked quickly around the room, worried.  What had he summoned?  The eyes seemed to blink once, and then winked out of existence.  There was still no one in the middle of his circle.  Had the spell failed? He could feel threads and waves of mana and pressure emanating from his warded spell circle. Deep in his chest, he felt something, like the dull sound of wood being cut in the distance. The feeling emanated from the circle. There was a sudden golden flash, and he threw up his hands to shield his eyes. The light was so strong that he could see through his flesh, pink web works of blood and bone silhouetted. 
					Pulses of light were coruscating in the center of his spell circle.  Danilan quickly scooped up the Crystal, and stepped back. Whatever the result, this had been the right thing to do. As the light faded, he prayed that it was true.
